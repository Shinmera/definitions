## Currently Supported Implementations
Some parts of this library such as the discovery of certain definitions, retrieval of some object bindings, and the source location tracking are implementation-specific. As such, in order to be complete, implementation-specific parts need to be written. Currently the following implementations are *fully* supported. Note that even if your implementation is not listed here, this library may still be useful.

* SBCL
